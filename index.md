# Cosmic Personalities
Hello, thanks for being here and support my work. 


### The collection will be available to sell this weekend 27/03. Here are some points about the minting process:
1. The collection will have 100 unique pieces in the Polygon Blockchain exclusively at OpenSea.
2. Minting proces will be 10 by 10 (we will call them groups) until we reach the 100 unique pieces.
3. The minting process will take 2 weeks between groups. With the exception of the second group that will come out a week after the first group.
4. First 10 minted NFT will cost 0.02 ETH, No diference between NFT's
5. Then every group will have a rise of their sell price of at least +0.01 ETH
